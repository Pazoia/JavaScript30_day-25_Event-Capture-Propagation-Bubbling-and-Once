# Wes Bos JavaScript30 - Challenge 25

In this challenge we are exploring the addEventListener.

This project is to help understanding some possible edge cases with  
event listeners.

Features:  
* Explaining how Capture works
* Explaining how Bubbling works
* Explaining how to use stopPropagation to avoid  
  the Bubbling from happening
* Explaining how to use Once to stop addEventListener  
  after the first event happens
